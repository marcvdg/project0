# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a 4-page website promoting my fictional copywriting business. It uses Bootstrap, together with a custom SCSS file for additional styling. The pages contain images, a table and a list, and are all based on a 5-1-6 grid on screens larger than the medium breakpoint (except for the about page, which breaks at large.) 

The custom.scss file contains all required (S)CSS properties, selectors, variables, and queries, with comments giving further explanation.  

Bootstrap components used: 
* navbar 
* button 
* alert


<!-- Your website must contain at least four different .html pages, and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
X Your website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least one table, and at least one image.
X Your website must have at least one stylesheet file.
